Our [Origin storefront theme](https://github.com/swellstores/origin-theme) is a ready-to-go PWA storefront built with Nuxt.js. It is configured and hosted automatically when creating a new store, but can be re-configured and replaced by a custom storefront, or hosted by another provider such as [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

For custom builds, Origin storefront serves as an ideal starting point or example implementation using Swell.js.
